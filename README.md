UNiT is a technically advanced and physically-inspired post-processing shader library for ReShade with optimization for real-time usage



**INCLUDED EFFECTS**:



**# A-GTVBAO: Analytical Ground-Truth Ambient Occlusion with Visiblity Bitmask.**

* A modern screen-space ambient occlusion algorithm using analytic integration over the horizon using a bit-field masking, allowing for precise geometry/object occlusion of almost any scene.





**# Stothastic Filmic Grain: Fast Physically Correct Filmic Grain.**

* A fully physically based film grain model that operates on the principle of the Poisson distribution, which is the same principle that silver crystals in film emulsions obey.





**# Luminescence (Lumi-Bloom): Technically Advanced Lens Light Scattering.**

* Simulation of the real process of light diffusion using several new techniques, which gives a pure-natural glow from point lights.





**# F-LLF: Fast Local Laplacian Filtering.**

* A visually correct implementation of the image local contrast enhancement algorithm based on the Fast Local Laplacian Filtering method, adapted for real-time usage.





**# Spectral CA: Chromatic Aberration via Spectrum Integration.**

* Using continuous integration over the wavelength spectrum to obtain realistic prism color dispersion.





**# Frequency Sharpen: Frequency-Domain Detail Restoration Technique.**

* An image sharpening method that uses frequency transform principles to highly accurate restore detail and enhance overall image detailing without contrast changing and halos.
