UNiT is a technically advanced and physically-inspired post-processing shader library for ReShade with optimization for real-time usage.

## **INCLUDED EFFECTS**:


### **A-GTVBAO: Analytical Ground-Truth Ambient Occlusion with Visibility Bitmask**
![Ambient Occlusion Debug](./assets/images/occlusion_img.jpg)
A modern screen-space ambient occlusion algorithm using analytic integration over the horizon using a bit-field masking, allowing for precise geometry/object occlusion of almost any scene.


### **Stochastic Filmic Grain: Fast Physically Correct Filmic Grain**
![Grains Film](./assets/images/grain_img.jpg)
A fully physically based film grain model that operates on the principle of the Poisson distribution, which is the same principle that silver crystals in film emulsions obey.


### **Luminescence (Lumi-Bloom): Technically Advanced Lens Light Scattering**
![Point Lights Show](./assets/images/bloom_img.jpg)
Simulation of the real process of light diffusion using several new techniques, which gives a pure-natural glow from point lights.


### **F-LLF: Fast Local Laplacian Filtering**
![LLF Comparison (Off/On)](./assets/images/llf_img.jpg)
A visually correct implementation of the image local contrast enhancement algorithm based on the Fast Local Laplacian Filtering method, adapted for real-time usage.


### **Spectral CA: Chromatic Aberration via Spectrum Integration**
![Prism Effect Showcase](./assets/images/prism_img.jpg)
Simulating of the realistic prism dispersion by using continuous spectrum integration over the wavelength.


### **Frequency Sharpen: Frequency-Domain Detail Restoration Technique**
![Sharpening Comparison](./assets/images/sharp_img.jpg)
An image sharpening method that uses frequency transform principles to highly accurate restore detail and enhance overall image detailing without contrast changing and halos.<br>
